= 3.4.11 kernel source code for Newman N1 (MT6577) =
====================================================

In order to get kernel compilation working, make sure you follow one of these steps:

- You have 3 folders: kernel, mediatek and toolchain.
  - kernel folder is the basic one, with the linux kernel sources.
  - mediatek folder contains dependences that are necessary to build for MTK platform.
  - toolchain folder contains the appropriate cross-compiler.


- In Terminal, cd to kernel folder.
  There is a script called build.sh.
  That is the interface you will use to build device kernel.

- Run script with command "./build.sh newmann1" to begin with the build process.
  Once finished, you will find:
  -- the new kernel file in root folder ./build_result/kernel/kernel
  -- the compiled modules in root folder ./build_result/modules/*.ko


- To perform a clean build run command "./build.sh clean newmann1".


- Create new boot.img:
  -- Get stock boot.img for device and unpack it.
  -- Repack the stock ramdisk (from stock boot.img) with the new generated kernel file.
